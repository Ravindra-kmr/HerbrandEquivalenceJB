1. Don't assign value number for terms (in assignment statment like p=q+1, we put p in same class as q+1 which is true but we put all terms containing p to a new class which is wrong, search for any variableOrConstant which is same as term containing p and assign its class) in increasing order but search recursively to find the value number.
 
2. Should we search in only variableUConstant or all terms in the list.

3. check for this one
p=1+3;
q=1+3;
I think the program will be able to find p and q in same class but all terms containing p or q will not be in same class. like p+1 and q+1 should be in same class but program will not print so.
